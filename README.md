# My Chess in C
A chess game entirely made in C language

## What?
![The chess game photo][photo1]

## Why?
* for fun
* I just learned C and wanted to build some project in it to learn more

## How?(for users)
First compile it using command  
```
make
```
**note: You must have gcc compiler(_you can use other compilers too if you know what you're doing_)**  
Now to use it, run
```
./start [white | black]
```
if you ommit the _side_ it'll assume you're playing as white

## How?(for devs)
Just fork it do whatever you want

## To-do_(including issues which I haven't fixed yet but know about it)
